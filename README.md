# Vehicle Number Plate Detection
Vehicle Number Plate Detection and Extraction of characters is a task of computer vision. Under this problem statement, we have to extract the characters from the number plate of cars or any vehicle. After the extraction of data from the number plate, we have to Identify the license place. The objective is to design efficient algorithms or model for doing this task. Before machine learning(ML) or deep learning(DL), computer programmers are using the pattern matching technique of solving OCR task, but due to less computation power at that time OCR programs are not used at a large scale, and mostly model fails to make correct predictions over real-life data. First OCR tools are invented and applied in industry, able to interpret **Morse code** and read text out loud (1931â€“1954). The **Intelligent Machines Research Corporation** is the first company created to sell such tools.
